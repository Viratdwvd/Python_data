## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
install.packages("dplyr")
library("dplyr")
```

```{r}
glimpse(mtcars)
```


```{r}
print(mtcars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r}
#. Display any 5 observations randomly. 
head(mtcars)
```
```{r}
#4. Display only a fraction of observations randomly.
filter(mtcars,cyl==6)
```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
#Display only the MPG column. 
select(mtcars,mpg)
```


```{r}
##6. Display the variables that starts with the letter ‘d’ 
select(mtcars,contains("d"))
```

```{r}
#Displays data in the columns from MPG to DISP without the CYL attribute. 
select(mtcars,mpg:disp,-cyl)
```

```{r}
#Display all records whose HP values are more than 125 and MPG less than 15.0
```


```{r}
filter(mtcars,hp>125 & mpg <15)
```


```{r}
#Include a new attribute NV by adding WT and MPG together.
```


```{r}
mutate(mtcars,nv=wt+mpg)
```


```{r}
mtcars%>% filter(hp>125)%>%group_by(am)%>%summarise(average=mean(wt))
```
```{r}
#10. Display the maximum and minimum HP value
summarise(mtcars,max_hp=max(hp),min_hp=min(hp))
```
```{r}
#11. Filter all the data with HP greater than 125 and arrange them in increasing order
#of MPG. 
mtcars %>% filter(hp>125)%>% arrange(mpg)
```
